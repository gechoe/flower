# FLOWER

This project, titled flower, allows for user interaction onto the window interface
by drawing lines. The goal here is to lead the path of the water coming from the
watering can to the flower pot/vase in order to water the flower. The title of
the mini game at the center of the screen, "FLOWER", is used as an obstruction in order for the user to get creative when drawing a path for the water.

A game that generates a watering can (at the top left corner of the screen), a vase with flowers (at the bottom right corner of the screen), and an obstruction (in the middle of the screen). Water particles fall from the watering can as soon as the program is run. The user then draws a path/ramp anywhere on the screen that there is open space and leads water from the watering can to the flower vase. Once the user hits start the water comes from the watering can flowing the drawn path and, hopefully, fills the vase.
